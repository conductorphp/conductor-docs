# Conductor PHP

## What is Conductor?

Conductor is a software development lifecycle tool for managing environments and performing production deployments.

With Conductor, you can:

* Ensure lower environments stay in sync with scrubbed production data
* Maintain common assets and files across environments
* Handle environment specific configuration differences
* Populate test data
* Perform reliable, immutable builds, snapshots, and deployments based on configured plans
* Select from a library of supported or community Composer packages to extend functionality
* Work with many different filesystems, databases, servers, and version control systems
* Conductor is written in PHP to allow you to easily customize or extend the functionality with your existing development team.
